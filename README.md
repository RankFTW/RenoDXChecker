## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Game not detected | Click **Add Game** in the toolbar or drag the game's `.exe` onto the window |
| Xbox games missing | Click **Refresh** — RDXC uses the PackageManager API |
| ReShade not loading | Check the install path via 📁 — `dxgi.dll` must be next to the game exe |
| Black screen (Unreal) | ReShade → Add-ons → RenoDX → set `R10G10B10A2_UNORM` to `output size` |
| UE-Extended not working | Turn on in-game HDR — UE-Extended requires native HDR output |
| Downloads failing | Click **Refresh**, or clear cache from Settings → Open Downloads Cache |
| Foreign DLL blocking install | Choose **Overwrite** in the dialog, or cancel to keep the existing file |
| Games/mods out of sync | Settings → **Full Refresh** to clear all caches |
