# RenoDX Commander (RDXC)

A desktop manager for HDR game mods on Windows. Auto-detects your game libraries, installs ReShade, RenoDX, and Luma Framework mods — all in a few clicks. Legacy Display Commander support available via opt-in toggle.

## Quick Start

1. **Run RDXC** — games are auto-detected from Steam, GOG, Epic, EA App, Ubisoft, Xbox/Game Pass, Battle.net, and Rockstar on every launch.
2. **Pick a game** from the sidebar. Use search or filter chips to narrow the list.

## Features

- **8-store game detection** — Steam, GOG, Epic, EA App, Ubisoft Connect, Xbox/Game Pass, Battle.net, Rockstar. New games appear automatically on every launch.
- **Graphics API detection** — scans game executables via PE header analysis to detect DirectX 11/12, Vulkan, and OpenGL. API badges shown on game cards.
- **Vulkan ReShade support** — installs ReShade as a global Vulkan implicit layer for Vulkan-rendered games, with per-game INI and shader deployment
- **One-click install/update/uninstall** for ReShade, RenoDX addons, and Luma Framework mods (Display Commander available via DC Legacy Mode)
- **Version display** — installed ReShade and Display Commander version numbers shown directly on the component row, including when DC Mode is active
- **DC Legacy Mode** — opt-in toggle in Settings that restores full Display Commander functionality for existing users. Off by default — all DC UI is hidden until enabled.
- **DC Mode** — On/Off toggle with a DLL filename picker controlling how Display Commander loads alongside ReShade (requires DC Legacy Mode)
- **Shader pack management** — 7 HDR shader packs with five deploy modes (Off, Minimum, All, User, Select) plus a per-game shader selection picker
- **Auto-save overrides** — all per-game settings save immediately when changed, no Save button needed
- **Per-game overrides** — DLL naming, shader mode/selection, DC mode, rendering path, wiki name mapping, wiki exclusion, per-component Update All inclusion, reset overrides
- **Seamless refresh** — after initial boot, refresh updates everything in the background without blanking the UI
- **DLL name conflict prevention** — ReShade and DC filename dropdowns cross-filter to prevent both using the same DLL name
- **Startup shader deployment** — on launch, shaders are automatically synced to all installed game folders for backwards compatibility
- **Drag-and-drop** — drop a game `.exe` to add it, drop an `.addon64`/`.addon32` to install it, or drop an archive to extract and install addons
- **Remote manifest** — game-specific overrides updated server-side without app releases, including engine overrides, DLL name overrides, and API overrides
- **UE-Extended & Native HDR** — automatic detection and addon assignment for Unreal Engine games
- **Engine detection** — Unreal, Unity, and custom engine names detected and displayed with icons
- **ReShadePreset.ini auto-deploy** — place a preset in the RDXC inis folder to have it copied to every game install automatically
- **Foreign DLL protection** — detects DXVK, Special K, ENB, etc. before overwriting
- **Auto-update** — checks for new RDXC versions on launch with stable and beta channels
- **Settings page** — DC Mode, shader mode, deploy actions, preferences, logs, about, and credits all in one place
- **Addon auto-detection** — watches your Downloads folder for new `renodx-*.addon64` / `.addon32` files and prompts you to install them. Configurable watch folder in Settings.
- **AddonPath support** — addon installs respect the `AddonPath` setting in `reshade.ini`, deploying addons to the configured folder instead of the game root
- **Luma author badges** — games in Luma mode show the Luma mod author (from the Luma wiki) in place of the RenoDX author badge
- **Filter mode persistence** — your selected filter tab is saved and automatically restored when you reopen the app
- **Toolbar redesign** — consistent teal accent styling with grouped sections separated by vertical dividers. Update button lights up purple when updates are available.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Game not detected | Click **Add Game** in the toolbar or drag the game's `.exe` onto the window |
| Xbox games missing | Click **Refresh** — RDXC uses the PackageManager API |
| ReShade not loading | Check the install path via 📁 — `dxgi.dll` must be next to the game exe |
| Black screen (Unreal) | ReShade → Add-ons → RenoDX → set `R10G10B10A2_UNORM` to `output size` |
| UE-Extended not working | Turn on in-game HDR — UE-Extended requires native HDR output |
| Downloads failing | Click **Refresh**, or clear cache from Settings → Open Downloads Cache |
| Foreign DLL blocking install | Choose **Overwrite** in the dialog, or cancel to keep the existing file |
| Games/mods out of sync | Settings → **Full Refresh** to clear all caches |
