# RHI — ReShade HDR Installer

RHI is a WinUI 3 desktop application for managing HDR mod installations on PC games. It auto-detects game libraries across eight storefronts, installs and updates ReShade, RenoDX, ReLimiter, Display Commander, RE Framework, and Luma Framework components, and keeps everything in sync — all from a single interface.

> **⚠ Single-player only:** RHI installs ReShade with full addon support, which may be flagged by anti-cheat in online/multiplayer games. Uninstall ReShade before playing online.

## Feature Highlights

- **Auto-detection** — scans Steam, GOG, Epic Games, EA App, Ubisoft Connect, Xbox/Game Pass, Battle.net, and Rockstar libraries on every launch
- **One-click install** — install, update, or uninstall ReShade, RenoDX, ReLimiter, Display Commander, RE Framework, and Luma Framework with a single button
- **Frame rate limiter choice** — ReLimiter and Display Commander are mutually exclusive per game; installing one disables the other
- **Drag-and-drop** — drop a game `.exe`, addon file, archive, or URL to add games and install mods instantly
- **Archive auto-install** — archives containing "renodx" in the filename (e.g. from Nexus Mods) are detected in your Downloads folder and installed automatically
- **Per-game overrides** — customise DLL naming, shader selection, and component update preferences per game
- **Update detection** — detect and apply component updates across all games with Update All (covers ReShade, RenoDX, ReLimiter, Display Commander, and RE Framework)
- **Shader pack management** — deploy and sync 40+ shader packs (Essential, Recommended, Extra) across installed games, with automatic dependency resolution
- **ReShade addon management** — browse, download, and toggle curated ReShade addons from the official list. Enabled addons are auto-deployed when ReShade is installed, removed when ReShade is uninstalled, and synced on every Refresh
- **ReShade preset deployment** — place `.ini` preset files in the reshade-presets folder and deploy them to any game from the overrides panel
- **Game report** — Copy Report button in the overrides panel generates a diagnostic code for Discord or GitHub issues, showing detected vs corrected settings
- **Performance** — parallel shader downloads, parallel game folder syncs, and cached graphics API detection for fast startup

## Quick Start

1. **Download and run RHI** — games are auto-detected from Steam, GOG, Epic Games, EA App, Ubisoft Connect, Xbox/Game Pass, Battle.net, and Rockstar.
2. **Select a game** from the sidebar. Use search or filter chips to narrow the list.
3. **Install components** from the detail panel — ReShade, RenoDX, and a frame rate limiter (ReLimiter or Display Commander) each have a one-click install button.
4. **Launch the game**, press **Home** to open the ReShade overlay, go to **Add-ons**, and configure RenoDX.

## Download & System Requirements

Grab the latest installer from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/RankFTW/RenoDXChecker/releases).

**Requires:** Windows 10/11 (x64) and [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Game not detected | Click **Add Game** in Settings or drag the game's `.exe` onto the window |
| Xbox games missing | Click **Refresh** — RHI uses the PackageManager API which may need a moment |
| ReShade not loading | Check the install path via 📁 — the ReShade DLL must be next to the game executable |
| Black screen (Unreal) | In ReShade → Add-ons → RenoDX, set `R10G10B10A2_UNORM` to `output size` |
| UE-Extended not working | Enable in-game HDR — UE-Extended requires native HDR output |
| Downloads failing | Click **Refresh**, or clear cache from Settings → Open Downloads Cache |
| Foreign DLL blocking install | Choose **Overwrite** in the confirmation dialog, or cancel to keep the existing file |
| Games/mods out of sync | Settings → **Full Refresh** to clear all caches and re-scan |
