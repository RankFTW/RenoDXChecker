## v1.4.5

### New Features

**Improved Unity engine detection**
- Unity games that don't have `UnityPlayer.dll` in the base folder are now detected correctly.
- Detection now also checks for `Mono` folder, `MonoBleedingEdge` folder, `il2cpp` folder, and `GameAssembly.dll` — all common markers of Unity IL2CPP and Mono builds.

**UE-Extended available for all generic Unreal Engine games**
- The UE-Extended toggle now appears for every Unreal Engine game that does not have a named mod on the RenoDX wiki, not just games explicitly listed in the manifest.
- A compatibility warning dialog now pops up when enabling UE-Extended, advising that not all games are compatible and to check the Notes section for any game-specific information.

**Manifest 32-bit / 64-bit flags**
- The `thirtyTwoBitGames` manifest flag now takes priority over automatic PE header detection, restoring the ability to force-flag a game as 32-bit from the manifest.
- A new `sixtyFourBitGames` manifest flag allows games incorrectly detected as 32-bit by the auto-detection to be force-flagged as 64-bit.

**Remember last view**
- The app now remembers whether it was last in Detail View or Grid View and opens in that same view on next launch.

**Installed filter**
- New filter button between All Games and Favourites that shows only games with RenoDX or Luma installed (DC and ReShade alone do not qualify).

**Manifest engine overrides**
- A new `engineOverrides` manifest field allows the engine for any game to be overridden.
- Setting a game to `"Unreal"` or `"Unity"` changes both its filter category and enables the correct generic mod/addon behaviour (UE-Extended eligibility, generic Unity addon, etc.).
- Setting a game to any other string (e.g. `"Silk"`, `"Source 2"`, `"Creation Engine"`) displays that label in the engine badge but keeps the game in the Other filter.
- Games with no known or overridden engine continue to show as Unknown and filter into Other.

**Manifest DLL name overrides**
- A new `dllNameOverrides` manifest field allows the ReShade and Display Commander install filenames to be set remotely per game.
- Example: `"Mirror's Edge": { "reshade": "d3d9.dll", "dc": "winmm.dll" }`. Either field may be empty to keep the default name.
- User-set per-game DLL overrides in the Manage panel always take priority over manifest values.

**ReShadePreset.ini auto-deploy**
- If a `ReShadePreset.ini` file is placed in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RenoDXCommander\inis\`, it is automatically copied to the game folder alongside `reshade.ini` on every ReShade or Display Commander install.
- The 📋 INI button on the ReShade row also copies the preset file if present.

**ReShade and Display Commander version display**
- The status label next to the ReShade and Display Commander install buttons now shows the installed version number (e.g. `6.7.3`) instead of just `Installed`.
- Falls back to `Installed` if no version information is available.
- Applies to both Detail View and the grid card Manage popout.

**Custom engine icon**
- Games with a custom engine name set via `engineOverrides` in the manifest now show a dedicated engine icon in the engine badge, rather than no icon.

### Changes

**Filter layout**
- The Other filter has been moved from the top row to the second row, now sitting between Unity and RenoDX.

**Change install folder now opens game folder**
- The folder picker for changing a game's install path now opens directly in the game's current folder instead of the last-used location.

### Bug Fixes

**UE-Extended toggle not applying**
- Clicking the UE-Extended button was silently ignored for games that had not yet been flagged as `IsGenericMod`, even though the button was visible. The eligibility check now matches the same conditions used to show the button.

**Games showing as installed after manual file removal**
- After a full Refresh, games with ReShade, Display Commander, or RenoDX manually deleted from the game folder were still showing as installed in the UI.
- RDXC now verifies that the installed file actually exists on disk when loading saved records. Stale records are automatically cleaned up and the correct status is shown immediately on the next Refresh.

**Manifest DLL name override not applying to existing installs**
- The `dllNameOverrides` manifest field was only used as the filename for new installs. Games already installed under a different filename were not renamed when the manifest override was applied.
- RDXC now renames existing ReShade and Display Commander files to match the manifest override on every Refresh, matching the behaviour of user-set DLL overrides.

**Manifest DLL name override not visible in UI**
- Games flagged via `dllNameOverrides` in the manifest were silently installing with the correct filename but the DLL naming override toggle in the Overrides section remained off, giving no indication anything was different.
- Games with a manifest DLL override now have the toggle turned on automatically and the filenames pre-filled, identical to a user-set override. The override can be disabled per-game and that preference is remembered across refreshes.

**Change install folder picker opening in Documents**
- The Change Install Folder button was opening the file picker in the Documents folder instead of the game's current install directory.
- The picker now opens directly in the game's folder using the native `IFileOpenDialog` COM interface, which correctly supports arbitrary start paths in WinUI 3 unpackaged apps.

---

## v1.4.4


### New Features

**Drag-and-drop archive extraction**
- Archives (.zip, .7z, .rar, .tar, .gz, .bz2, .xz) can now be dragged directly onto the RDXC window. The archive is extracted using the bundled 7-Zip, and any `.addon64` or `.addon32` files inside are automatically found and installed via the existing addon install flow.
- If multiple addon files are found inside an archive, a picker dialog lets you choose which one to install.
- If no addon files are found, a clear message is shown.

**32bit Mod**

- 32bit Mode has been replaced by automatic detection of 32bit game executables. Thanks to Lazorr for implementing this and Jon for the starting point.

### Changes

**Grid view wiki status icon**
- Each game card in grid view now displays the wiki status icon on the same row as the RDX/RS/DC installation dots, right-aligned.
- The wiki status shows only the icon, not the full text label. Hovering shows the full label as a tooltip.
- ✅ = Working (listed on RenoDX wiki). 🚧 = In Progress (listed on wiki). ⚠️ = May Work (not on wiki but Unreal/Unity engine detected). ❓ = Unknown (not on wiki, no known engine). 💬 = Discord-only.
- Games in Luma mode do not show a wiki status icon on the grid card.

### Bug Fixes

**Wiki parser now handles all table formats**
- The RenoDX wiki splits its game list across multiple tables with varying column layouts (3-column, 4-column, status in different positions). The parser previously only read the first 4-column table, missing ~40% of games. It now detects table structure by examining header text (Name/Maintainer/Links/Status) and parses every mod table on the page regardless of column count or order. This fixes games like Lies of P, Aragami 2, EVERSPACE 2, CODE VEIN, Avatar, Pacific Drive, and many others showing incorrect wiki status.

---

## v1.4.3

### New Features

**Grid View**

- Users now have the option of using a Grid View. Switch between Grid View and Detail View easily with the click of a button. Each game can now be managed from a smaller pop out while in Grid View.

### Changes

**Background Maintainance**

- Removed excess flyouts in Detail View.
- Cleaned up some code.

---

## v1.4.2

### Changes

**UI Tweaks**

- Layout change on game cards 

---

## v1.4.1

### Changes

**Code refinement**

- Additional UI cleanup and redundant code removal.

---

## v1.4.0

### Changes

**New UI design**

- Brand new UI designed by Lazorr as well as multiple background tweaks and fixes. 

---

## v1.3.7

### Changes

**ReShade INI deployed with DC Mode installs**
- Installing Display Commander in DC Mode now automatically deploys the template `reshade.ini` to the game folder using the same merge logic as standalone ReShade installs. If no INI exists, the template is copied; if one already exists, template keys are merged on top while preserving game-specific settings.

### Bug Fixes

**Foreign DLL backup not triggering for OptiScaler and similar tools**
- Fixed `dxgi.dll` files from OptiScaler (and other tools that mention "ReShade" in config comments) being misidentified as ReShade and overwritten instead of backed up to `.original`. The binary scan now only matches on `reshade.me` or `crosire` — strings unique to the actual ReShade binary — and rejects files over 15 MB as too large to be ReShade.

---

## v1.3.6

### New Features

**Battle.net game detection**
- RDXC now automatically detects games installed via the Battle.net (Blizzard) launcher.
- Detection uses Windows Uninstall registry entries (filtering by Blizzard/Activision publisher), the Battle.net config file (`Battle.net.config`) for the default install path, and default folder scanning under `Program Files\Battle.net` and `Blizzard Entertainment`.
- Battle.net games appear with a dedicated platform icon on game cards and in the compact mode game list.
- Drag-and-drop exe detection now recognises Battle.net store markers (`.build.info`, `.product.db`).

**Rockstar Games Launcher detection**
- RDXC now automatically detects games installed via the Rockstar Games Launcher.
- Detection uses Windows Uninstall registry entries (filtering by Rockstar publisher), the launcher's `titles.dat` file for install paths, and default folder scanning under `Program Files\Rockstar Games`.
- Rockstar games appear with a dedicated platform icon on game cards and in the compact mode game list.
- Drag-and-drop exe detection now recognises Rockstar store markers (`PlayGTAV.exe`, `socialclub*.dll`).

### Changes

**Compact UI layout rework**
- The top header bar (logo, title, search box) is now completely hidden in compact mode. The filter bar is the topmost bar.
- The search box has been moved to the right-hand toolbar, placed below the About button.
- The RDXC logo is displayed below the search box on the right toolbar.
- The "RDXC RenoDXCommander" title text is no longer shown in compact mode.
- The first game alphabetically is now auto-selected when entering compact mode, so the view is never empty on launch.

**About panel version**
- The About panel now correctly displays the current version number.

**Scroll and selection preservation**
- Favouriting or unfavouriting a game no longer resets the scroll position in full UI mode or deselects the game in compact mode.
- Refresh and Full Refresh now restore the previous scroll position in full UI and re-select the previously selected game in compact mode.

**ReShade INI merge**
- Installing ReShade or clicking the 📋 INI button now merges the template `reshade.ini` into the game's existing INI instead of overwriting it. Template keys always take precedence, but any game-specific settings not in the template (e.g. addon configs, effect toggles, custom keybinds) are preserved.

---

## v1.3.5

### Bug Fixes

**Drag-and-drop crash loop (source icon binding)**
- Fixed an infinite crash loop when dragging and dropping a game exe into the window. The platform source icon binding threw `ArgumentException` when the game had no known store source (e.g. manually added games), because WinUI's `ConvertValue` cannot convert `null` to an `ImageSource`. The icon is now bound via an explicit `BitmapImage` with a typed `Uri`, bypassing `ConvertValue` entirely.

**Added games appear in correct alphabetical position**
- Games added via drag-and-drop or the ➕ Add Game button now appear in their correct alphabetical position in the game list immediately, instead of being appended to the bottom.

---

## v1.3.4

### New Features

**Ubisoft Connect game detection**
- RDXC now automatically detects games installed via Ubisoft Connect (formerly Uplay).
- Detection uses registry keys, the launcher's `settings.yml` configuration, and default install folder scanning.
- Ubisoft games appear with a dedicated platform icon on game cards and in the compact mode game list.
- Drag-and-drop exe detection now recognises Ubisoft store markers (`uplay_install.state`, `uplay_*.dll`).

### Changes

**DLL naming override — rename instead of delete**
- Enabling DLL naming override now renames existing ReShade/DC DLLs to the custom filenames instead of uninstalling them, keeping installs tracked without requiring a reinstall.
- When override filenames are changed while already enabled, existing custom-named files are renamed in place to the new names.
- Both Full UI and Compact UI now use the new rename path when DLL overrides are already active and only the filenames change.

**Compact view — selection preserved after save**
- After saving overrides in Compact mode, the previously selected game card is automatically re-selected once filtering finishes, preventing the selection from jumping unexpectedly.

**Deploy buttons — confirmation dialogs**
- The **🎨 Deploy Shaders** and **⚙ Deploy DC Mode** buttons now show a confirmation dialog asking to Continue or Cancel before executing bulk operations.

### Bug Fixes

**Search box clear button visibility**
- The search box now consistently shows the ✕ clear button as soon as you type the first character, instead of appearing only after further edits.

**Addon download and drag-and-drop — extension validation**
- Downloads and drag-and-drop addon installs now validate the resolved filename extension before any network or file activity, rejecting non-`.addon64` / `.addon32` files with a clear error message and skipping the download.

**Luma snapshot security — trusted source guard**
- Luma snapshot downloads are now restricted to GitHub URLs under `https://github.com/Filoppi/`. Any other URL is rejected with an error before any network request is made.

---

## v1.3.3

### New Features

**Compact UI Mode**
- Added an alternative "Compact" layout alongside the existing "Full" UI.
- Compact mode shows an alphabetical game list on the left, the selected game's card and overrides in the center, and all toolbar buttons vertically on the right.
- Toggle between modes with the 📐 button — in the header when in Full mode, or at the top of the right toolbar when in Compact mode.
- The UI mode preference is saved and persists across app restarts.

**Platform source icons**
- Game cards and the compact mode game list now display platform-specific icons (Steam, GOG, Epic, EA App, Xbox) instead of plain text badges.

**Remote manifest system**
- Game-specific overrides (blacklist, install path corrections, wiki status, game notes, shader packs, Luma defaults, native HDR list) are now driven by a remote manifest hosted on GitHub. This allows quick fixes and new game support without requiring an app update.
- The manifest is fetched from the GitHub API on launch with a raw.githubusercontent.com fallback, and cached locally for offline use.

**Wiki unlinks (manifest)**
- The remote manifest can now unlink games from false fuzzy wiki matches. Unlinked games fall through to their generic engine addon (Unreal or Unity) instead of being incorrectly associated with a named wiki mod.

**Luma always enabled**
- Luma Framework support is no longer hidden behind a settings toggle. Luma badges appear on all eligible game cards by default. The "Luma (Experimental)" setting has been removed from About → Settings.

**Luma auto-default for specific games**
- Games listed in the remote manifest automatically start in Luma mode on first detection, without requiring manual toggling.

**Luma-specific game notes**
- The ℹ info popup now shows custom Luma-specific notes (from the remote manifest) when a game is in Luma mode, providing tailored guidance beyond the standard wiki notes.

### Changes

**Filter bar rework**
- Removed the "Installed" and "Not Installed" filter tabs.
- Added a "RenoDX" tab that shows only games with RenoDX wiki mods available.
- The "Luma" tab is now always visible (previously required enabling Luma in Settings).

**Wiki status for unmatched Unity/Unreal games**
- Unity and Unreal Engine games that don't match any wiki entry now display a "🚧 Unknown" status badge with amber colouring instead of being left blank, indicating they may become supported in future.

**Compact list update highlight**
- Games in the compact mode list now show a highlighted border when an update is available.

**Per-mode window size persistence**
- Full UI and Compact UI each remember their own window size independently. Switching modes restores the last-used size for that mode.

**"Extended UE" tag support**
- The remote manifest can now tag Unreal Engine games as "Extended UE", which automatically assigns the UE-Extended addon and marks the game as native HDR.

**Game Info dialog enlarged**
- The ℹ info popup's maximum height increased from 400 to 440 pixels to reduce clipping of longer notes.

### Bug Fixes

**Nexus link icon not appearing**
- Fixed the 🌐 Nexus/external link button not appearing on game cards where a Nexus URL was available but no snapshot was present.

**Luma badge dimming**
- The Luma toggle badge now uses a dimmer green when active, making it easier to distinguish from the bright "available" state.

**UE-Extended button sizing**
- Fixed the ⚡ UE-Extended toggle button being taller and wider than adjacent buttons on game cards.

---

## v1.3.2

### Bug Fixes

**Game rename persistence for games with folder overrides**
- Fixed games with custom folder overrides losing their rename after a Refresh. The rename is now stored under both the overridden and original install paths, so it survives the Init ordering where renames are applied before folder overrides.

### Changes

**Reset button in Overrides dialog**
- A new ↩ Reset button next to the Game Name and Wiki Name fields restores the game name to the original store-detected name and clears the wiki name mapping. Saving with an empty wiki field now also removes any existing mapping.

**Luma wiki name matching respects name mappings**
- The wiki name mapping (set in the Overrides dialog) now also applies to Luma mod matching. Previously, only RenoDX wiki matching consulted name mappings — Luma games with non-standard store names had to match exactly.

---

## v1.3.1

### Bug Fixes

**Settings persistence across updates**
- Fixed custom game folders, game renames, and DLL naming overrides being reset on every app launch. Observable-property change handlers were triggering a settings save before all fields had finished loading, overwriting persisted values with empty defaults.

**Foreign DLL protection during DC Mode switches**
- Switching DC Mode on no longer deletes foreign `dxgi.dll` or `winmm.dll` files (e.g. DXVK, Special K). Foreign DLLs are renamed to `.original` and automatically restored when DC vacates the slot (mode off or mode change).
- The same backup/restore logic applies during DC and ReShade installs and uninstalls.

**False Unity engine detection from artbook folders**
- Games bundling a digital artbook viewer (or similar bonus-content subfolder) with its own exe or `UnityPlayer.dll` are no longer misdetected as Unity. Artbook, soundtrack, manual, and bonus-content folders are now excluded from engine heuristic searches.

**ReShade button disabled during DC Mode**
- The ReShade install/reinstall button on each game card is now greyed out when DC Mode is active for that game, preventing accidental per-game ReShade installs that would conflict with the shared DC Mode ReShade path.

### Changes

**Faster startup — engine and addon detection caching**
- Engine detection results (Unreal, Unity, etc.) and resolved install paths are now cached in the game library. On subsequent launches, expensive filesystem traversals are skipped entirely for previously scanned games.
- Addon file scan results are cached by filename. Games with a known addon on disk skip the recursive directory search on subsequent launches.
- The Unreal Engine 3 legacy detection heuristic now checks cheap markers first (TAGame folder, Engine\Config\BaseEngine.ini) before any file searches, and uses depth-limited scans (3–4 levels) instead of full-tree traversals.
- The library save after card building now runs on a background thread instead of blocking the UI.

**↻ Full Refresh button**
- A new compact ↻ button next to the Refresh button clears all engine, path, and addon caches and re-scans everything from disk. Use this when game files have changed or detection results seem stale.

**Verbose Logging toggle**
- New toggle in About → Settings: **Verbose Logging**. When enabled, all activity is continuously logged to `rdxc_log.txt` in the logs folder. The log auto-rotates at 5 MB. Useful for diagnosing issues — send the log file to the developer alongside any bug reports.

---

## v1.3.0

### New Features

**Automatic ReShade updates from reshade.me**
- RDXC no longer bundles ReShade DLLs. Instead, it downloads the latest ReShade with full addon support directly from reshade.me on every launch.
- The latest version is detected by parsing the reshade.me homepage for the addon download link. The setup exe is downloaded to the AppData cache, and `ReShade64.dll` / `ReShade32.dll` are extracted using 7-Zip (bundled).
- If a newer version is available than what is currently installed in your games, a purple **⬆ Update ReShade** button appears — just like DC and RenoDX updates.
- Old installer exes are automatically cleaned up after a successful update. The version is tracked in a local marker file so redundant downloads are skipped.
- If the reshade.me check fails (e.g. offline), RDXC continues using whatever DLLs are already cached.

**DC Mode 2 (winmm.dll)**
- DC Mode now has three levels: Off → Mode 1 (`dxgi.dll`) → Mode 2 (`winmm.dll`) → Off.
- Mode 2 installs Display Commander as `winmm.dll` instead of `dxgi.dll`, freeing the `dxgi.dll` slot for other tools or proxy chains.
- The DC Mode button in the header cycles through all three states. Button label, colours, and tooltip update dynamically.
- A new **⚙ Deploy DC Mode** button next to the DC Mode button applies DC Mode file renames immediately without triggering a full library rescan.
- File renames during DC Mode switches are ordered to avoid `dxgi.dll` collisions: when turning ON, ReShade is renamed first to free `dxgi.dll`; when turning OFF, DC is renamed first.

**Per-game DC Mode override**
- The **🎯 Overrides** dialog now includes a DC Mode dropdown with four options: **Follow Global**, **Force Off**, **Force DC Mode 1**, and **Force DC Mode 2**.
- Per-game overrides take precedence over the global DC Mode level for both installs and DC Mode deploy operations.
- Saving the override applies the DC Mode switch for that game immediately — no Refresh needed.

**Xbox / Game Pass detection**
- RDXC now detects Xbox and Game Pass games via the Windows PackageManager API. Games with a `MicrosoftGame.config` are identified automatically; a filesystem fallback scans `.GamingRoot` files, registry, and common folder names.
- Xbox games appear alongside Steam, GOG, Epic, and EA App titles with an **Xbox** source badge.

**🎨 Shader deploy button**
- A new **🎨** button next to the Shaders cycle button deploys the current shader mode to all installed games immediately — no Refresh required.
- Saving a per-game shader override in the 🎯 Overrides dialog also triggers a shader deploy for that game automatically.

**Foreign winmm.dll protection**
- When installing Display Commander as `winmm.dll` (DC Mode 2), RDXC now checks whether an existing `winmm.dll` belongs to another tool using binary signature scanning — the same protection that already existed for `dxgi.dll`.
- If the file cannot be positively identified as Display Commander, a confirmation dialog asks whether to overwrite it. During Update All, unidentified foreign `winmm.dll` files are silently skipped.

### Bug Fixes

**Luma-only games showing Discord link when Luma is off**
- Games that only have a Luma mod (no RenoDX wiki mod) no longer show the Discord link button when the Luma feature is disabled.

**UE3 Win32 detection**
- Fixed Unreal Engine 3 games with only a `Binaries\Win32` folder not being detected as UE legacy. The engine heuristic now checks for `Binaries\Win32` alongside `Win64`.

**reshade.ini restoration for standalone ReShade installs**
- When ReShade is installed without DC Mode and no `reshade.ini` exists in the game folder, RDXC now copies the bundled INI automatically — matching the behaviour that already existed for DC Mode installs.

**DC Mode DLL override fix**
- Games with a custom DLL naming override that are also excluded from DC Mode no longer have their ReShade file incorrectly renamed during DC Mode deploy operations.

**Settings resilience across updates**
- All user settings (game renames, DLL overrides, folder overrides, hidden/favourite state) now load independently per-key. A single corrupt setting no longer wipes all other preferences.
- Hidden games and favourites are now also persisted in settings.json alongside all other preferences.

**Update check file lock errors**
- Fixed "file is being used by another process" errors during RenoDX UE-Extended and Display Commander update checks. Concurrent checks now use unique temp files.

### Changes

**Header button layout**
- Reordered header buttons: DC Mode → ⚙ Deploy DC → 🎨 Shaders → 🎨 Deploy Shaders → ⬆ Update All → ➕ Add Game → 💬 Support → ↻ Refresh → About.
- About button icon changed to 🧁.

**Header button tooltips**
- Added tooltips to the Add Game, Refresh, and About buttons for consistency with other header buttons.

**Blacklisted non-game apps**
- Added QuickPasta, Apple Music, DSX, PlayStation®VR2 App, SteamVR, Telegram Desktop, and Windows to the permanent exclusion list.
- System paths (e.g. `C:\WINDOWS`) are now filtered out from EA App detection to prevent OS directories appearing as games.

**7-Zip bundled**
- 7z.exe and 7z.dll are now bundled with RDXC for ReShade installer extraction. 7-Zip by Igor Pavlov, licensed under LGPL-2.1 / BSD-3-Clause.

---

## v1.2.9

### New Features

**DLL naming override**
- New per-game override in the **🎯 Overrides** dialog that lets you customise the filenames ReShade and Display Commander are installed as.
- A **📝 DLL naming override** toggle enables the feature. Two side-by-side text boxes set the ReShade and DC filenames. The boxes are greyed out until the toggle is switched on.
- When DLL override is enabled, existing ReShade and DC installations are automatically removed. The game is also automatically excluded from DC Mode, Update All, and global shader deployment — shader mode must be set manually.
- When DLL override is toggled off, the custom-named files are removed from the game folder.
- Works in both normal and 32-bit mode. Default placeholder names adjust based on 32-bit mode.
- Override settings persist across app restarts and game renames.

**Install folder override**
- Changing a game's install folder via the 📁 menu now persists across app restarts and Refresh. The chosen folder is used for all installations (ReShade, DC, RenoDX) and for "Open in Explorer".
- The **🔄 Reset folder / Remove game** menu option resets auto-detected games back to their original store-detected folder. For manual games, it removes the game entirely as before.

**ReShade 6.7.3**
- Bundled ReShade updated from 6.7.2 to 6.7.3. On first launch after updating, the new DLLs are automatically staged to the AppData cache. Games with ReShade installed will show a purple update notification.

### Bug Fixes

**Renamed games duplicating after app update**
- Fixed games appearing twice (renamed + original) after updating the app. The library merge now deduplicates by both normalized name and install path, preventing the cached renamed version from co-existing with the freshly-detected original.

### Changes

**Overrides dialog layout**
- Game name and Wiki name fields are now side-by-side in matching format.
- Removed description text at top.
- New layout order: Game name / Wiki name → DLL override → Exclude from wiki → Exclude from DC → Exclude from Update All → 32-bit mode → Shader mode.

---

## v1.2.8

### New Features

**Luma Framework integration (Experimental)**
- Luma support is disabled by default. Enable it from About → Settings → Luma (Experimental).

**Game rename**
- The game name field in the Overrides dialog is now editable. Renames persist across Refresh and app restarts.

**Drag-and-drop addon install**
- Dragging a .addon64 or .addon32 file onto the RDXC window installs it for a chosen game with confirmation.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed RenoDX update detection (inverted logic suppressing real updates).
- Fixed DC update button never turning purple (DcRecord not assigned during BuildCards).
- Fixed Update All button colour not updating after checks.
- Fixed Luma false matching, info notes overflow, uninstall on mode toggle, shader pack install.
- Improved EA App game detection (registry, publisher keys, folder scanning).
